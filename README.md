# spec-index.vim
Read and navigate your rspec/mocha/etc. tests in a location list window.

## Install

I like [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim):

```
Plugin 'artemave/spec-index.vim'
" optionally set the mapping
nnoremap <Leader>si :call ShowSpecIndex()<cr>
```

But any other installation method works too.
